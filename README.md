# MNIST Digit Classification Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates my understanding and implementation of a machine learning model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. I used TensorFlow and Keras to build, train, and evaluate a neural network capable of recognizing digits (0-9) from grayscale 28x28 pixel images.

## Key Features of the Project

Data Preprocessing:

* Loaded and visualized the MNIST dataset.

* Normalized the pixel values to fall within the range [0, 1] for better model performance.

### Model Architecture:

* Created a Sequential model with the following layers:

* Flatten: To convert 28x28 images into 1D arrays.

* Dense: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation.

* Dense: Output layer with softmax activation for classification into 10 categories.

### Compilation:

* Used the Adam optimizer for efficient gradient descent.

* Set the loss function as sparse_categorical_crossentropy for multi-class classification.

* Tracked the model's performance using accuracy as the evaluation metric.

### Training and Evaluation:

* Trained the model on the MNIST training dataset for 10 epochs.

* Validated the model using a validation split during training.

* Evaluated the model's performance on the test dataset and obtained the accuracy.

### Predictions:

* Converted the model's prediction probabilities into class labels using np.argmax().

* Evaluated predictions for individual images and the entire test dataset.
